function [cevent] = cevent_subtract(cevent1, cevent2)
% cevent_subtract  takes two cevents and subtract the shared segments between
% two from cevent1 to generate a new version of cevent1  
%
% Warning: this is accomplished using a transformation to a cstream, so a cevent
% that has overlapping events will lose this overlapping data!  Also, the start
% and end times of the events may change by a small amount.

% cevent_subtract(cevent1, cevent2)

% Output: a new event of cevent1 without shared moments of these two events
